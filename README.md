# Text-Generation-using-VAE-Beta-VAE

There are several research papers showing that the results of beta-VAE on image encoding is much far better than that of VAE. But, there are uncertainity regarding the performance of beta-VAE and VAE on the task of text generation.
So, this project was an attempt to see and compare the preformance of beta-VAE and VAE on text encoding task.

Two datasets were used for this task: -
  1) Quora question-pair dataset https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs/data
